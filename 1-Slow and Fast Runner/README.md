### Slow and Fast Runner
#### Pattern: Two Pointers

The first idea is to use two pointers as `slow runner` and `fast runner`. Each of them flags a key point during traversal. In general, fast runner grows each iteration and slow runner grows with some restrictions. By that, we can process logic based on these two runners.
